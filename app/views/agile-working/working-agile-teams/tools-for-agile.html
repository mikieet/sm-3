            <h2 class="heading-medium">The roadmap</h2>
             <p>
              The roadmap is visual overview of a project’s goals and shows the direction a service will take. It is produced during the discovery phase.
            </p>
            <h4 class="heading-small">Why you need a roadmap</h4>
             <p>
              The roadmap will be used to inform the business case you’ll need to write to move your project into the alpha phase. You’ll measure project progress against the goals in the roadmap and modify them as you learn more about user needs.
            </p>
            <h3 class="heading-small">How to make a roadmap</h3>
            <p>
              You need to start with the project’s vision and goals that were created in the discovery phase. Along with your team, plot these goals against your project’s phases to create a roadmap.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can use your wall to show your road map and record it in a spreadsheet.
            </p>

            <h2 class="heading-medium">The agile wall</h2>
             <p>
              Physical walls show what work is being planned and worked on, create a focus for the team and promote transparency.
            </p>
            <img src="http://dummyimage.com/600x400/4d494d/686a82.gif&text=placeholder+image" alt="placeholder+image">
            <h4 class="heading-small">Why have a wall</h4>
            <p>
              In agile working, visual management and face to face communication are fundamental to a project’s success. The wall promotes both of these; the team has their daily stand up around their wall and update it throughout the day.            
            </p>
            <p>
              Instead of keeping ideas, plans and work-in-progress buried in digital tools, charts and emails, teams can manage their workflow through their walls.
            </p>
            <p>
              Anyone should be able to look at an agile wall and be able to understand a project. If a wall can’t be easily understood (eg it’s not immediately clear where the team is blocked), it’s up to the team’s delivery manager to make improvements.
            </p>
            <h4 class="heading-small">What goes on a wall</h4>
            <p>
              Walls will differ from team to team, however most walls are used to manage what: 
            </p>
            <ol class="list-bullet">
              <li>the team have yet to start work on</li>
              <li>they’re currently doing</li>
              <li>they’ve already done</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Work to do is represented as cards that are moved along the wall. Sometimes cards are annotated, eg to show who’s working on them or that the work is blocked.
            </p>
            <p>
              Team walls capture the flow of work through different stages.
            </p>
            <p>
              The team should also track:
            </p>
            <ol class="list-bullet">
              <li>progress against their goals and key performance indicators (KPIs) – for live data this could be shown on an electronic dashboard like the <a href="https://gov.uk/performance">GDS performance platform</a></li>
              <li>risks and issues</li>
              <li>major obstacles to delivery (‘blockers’)</li>
              <li>important deadlines and dependencies</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Information about the service and team is also commonly shown, like:
            </p>
            <ol class="list-bullet">
              <li>the service vision and roadmap (goals)</li>
              <li>who is in the team</li>
              <li>what their working arrangements are, eg when their show and tells are held</li>
            </ol>
            <h4 class="heading-small">Examples</h4>
            <p>
              How GDS uses the agile wall is discussed in the blog post <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2012/12/19/the-agile-wall">The role of the agile wall.</a> 
            </p>
            <img src="http://dummyimage.com/600x400/4d494d/686a82.gif&text=placeholder+image" alt="placeholder+image">
            <p>
              This wall is used to manage a software team’s work. It shows their goals, successes and a simple flow of tasks: to do - in progress - in review - to deploy - done. 
            </p>
            <img src="http://dummyimage.com/600x400/4d494d/686a82.gif&text=placeholder+image" alt="placeholder+image">
            <p>
              This is a section of the wall used to manage the transfer of departments and agency websites to GOV.UK. It uses a similar flow of tasks but on a much larger scale.
            </p>

            <h2 class="heading-medium">User stories</h2>
             <p>
              The agile way to plan, organise and prioritise your work, and be clear about what your goals are. 
            </p>
            <h4 class="heading-small">What user stories are</h4>
            <p>
              User stories are a way of organising your work into manageable chunks that create tangible value, and can be discussed and prioritised independently.
            </p>
            <p>
              A user story briefly explains:
            </p>
            <ol class="list-bullet">
              <li>the person using the service (actor)</li>
              <li>what the user needs the service for (narrative)</li>
              <li>why the user needs it (goal)</li>
            </ol>
            <h4 class="heading-small">Why write user stories?</h4>
            <p>
              User stories are an essential part of the agile toolkit. The story card is a placeholder, a promise to have a conversation when the time is right. You use the story card and some brief initial conversations to estimate the amount of time a story needs to be completed and then put it into an agile backlog.
            </p>
            <p>
              When work actually starts, you consult the users or user representative to fill out the story details. A user story is the sum of all of these conversations, sketches and whiteboard diagrams – not just the card. You don’t need to write down or archive your conversations. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Using user stories in this way allows you to avoid ‘analysis paralysis’, the painful condition of trying to guess the details of some far-future goal.
            </p>
            <h4 class="heading-small">Who should write user stories</h4>
            <p>
              User stories can be added to a product backlog at any point in the sprint cycle by any person in the team. It’s up to the product owner to coordinate and prioritise them, and to select stories for each sprint at the start of each sprint cycle.
            </p>
            <h4 class="heading-small">How to write user stories</h4>
            <p>
              When writing a user story, make sure the story is well-formed. Don’t skip the part explaining why there’s a need for a service just because it can be difficult.
            </p>
            <p>
              If stories are too big then split them into smaller stories.
            </p>
            <h4 class="heading-small">Structure</h4>
            <p>
              Story cards follow a standard structure:
            </p>
            <ol class="list-bullet">
              <li>title</li>
              <li>actor</li>
              <li>narrative</li>
              <li>goal</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              They don’t capture every detail, but you should have a more in-depth discussion about a user story at the appropriate time.
            </p>
            <p>Actor:    As a    journalist<br/>
            Narrative:  I want to see contact information for the news article I’m reading<br/>                        
            Goal:   So that   I can get directly in touch with the press office about it</p>
            <p>
              You might want to include a list of acceptance criteria. These should be a reminder for things to test or check which may have come up during conversation, but they should not be used as a way of defining the scope of a story.
            </p>
            <h4 class="heading-small">Actor</h4>
            <p>
              Being specific about the actor will help you to break down interactions into logical chunks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sometimes the actor will be a user of your service, or the actor will be an administrator, technician or manager in your organisation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Make sure you already have a good understanding of your users from your initial project work or existing research. If not, take the time to develop that understanding.
            </p>
            <h4 class="heading-small">Narrative</h4>
            <p>
              Use this as a reminder of the main interaction that needs to be addressed as part of the user experience. Remember that the story card does not need to spell out every detail.
            </p>
            <h4 class="heading-small">Goal</h4>            
            <p>
              Use this to help you decide whether the story is “done” or delivered, ie does the work meet the goal of the user?
            </p>
            <p>
              When writing stories with your development team, always start by thinking about and discussing your users’ goals:
            </p>
            <ol class="list-bullet">
              <li>why do they want to use your service?</li>
              <li>what are they trying to achieve?</li>
              <li>what need has motivated them to seek out your service?</li>
              <li>in what context do they use it – at home/work/on a mobile phone/whilst caring for a child?</li>
              <li>how often do they use it?</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Suzanne and James Robertson have excellent advice on this in the book Mastering the Requirements Process (3rd edition).
            </p>
            <h4 class="heading-small">Acceptance criteria</h4>
            <p>
              Acceptance criteria can be used to determine when a story is done. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Only include these on the back of the story card if the team finds them useful for recording user assumptions they might later forget. Sometimes writing acceptance criteria on the story card is useful where the user or user representative is not immediately available but is no substitute at all for face-to-face conversation.
            </p>
            <h4 class="heading-small">User story cards</h4>
            <p>
              A user story is represented through a story card that has a title and a few lines of text.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your story cards can be virtual, as well as actual cards. On a large product or service keep your stories in a digital format, and then turn them into physical cards as part of sprint planning.
            </p>
            <h4 class="heading-small">How to get user stories</h4>
            <p>
              Stories can come from many places, but the most common sources include:
            </p>
            <ol class="list-bullet">
                <li>Story writing workshops – more commonly at the start of a project, the development team and stakeholders will get together to write stories</li>
                <li>user interviews with real users – ideally, you will set up a user panel which the development team have ongoing access to</li>
                <li>user representatives embedded within your team – this may include the service manager or product owner</li>
                <li>observation – watch real users using your service</li>
            </ol>

            <h2 class="heading-medium">Sprint planning</h2>
            <p>
              A meeting where you’ll agree what work you need to do in your next sprint.
            </p>
            <h4 class="heading-small">What sprint planning is</h4>
            <p>
              You do sprint planning at the start of each sprint. There are 2 parts to it:
            </p>
            <ol class="list-bullet">
              <li>what we’ll do</li>
              <li>Twelve Principles of the Agile Manifesto – http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html</li>
              <li>how we’ll do it</li>
            </ol>
            <h3 class="heading-medium">How sprint planning works</h3>
            <h4 class="heading-small">Before sprint planning</h4>
            <p>
              You need to write user stories with acceptance criteria before the meeting.
            </p>
            <p>
              Discuss the stories ahead of sprint planning with:
            </p>
            <ol class="list-bullet">
              <li>relevant team members</li>
              <li>subject matter experts</li>
              <li>stakeholders</li>
            </ol>
            <h4 class="heading-small">At sprint planning</h4>
            <p>
              The product owner should read out the stories and explain the acceptance criteria in order of priority. It’s the job of the team to:
            </p>
            <ol class="list-bullet">
              <li>understand the story and acceptance criteria</li>
              <li>agree on the number of user stories they’ll aim to achieve within each sprint</li>
              <li>agree on the tasks needed to complete it</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              A good description of sprint planning is on the Agile Learning Labs website.
            </p>
            <p>
              This meeting can be hard to get right with large teams. Some people want to dig deep and question every story; others want to keep moving and don’t want to go into detail. Persevere!
            </p>


            <h2 class="heading-medium">Agile planning software</h2>
            <p>
              Agile planning boards are another way of managing a team’s work along with the wall. User stories are recorded as tickets on planning boards using software such as Pivotal Tracker, Trello, KanbanFlow.
            </p>
            <h4 class="heading-small">Why use planning boards</h4>
            <p>
              The best requirements and designs emerge from self-organising teams. Planning boards mean the team can create, update and pick up tickets to work on themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              They also allow team members to see what is being worked on and by who. A well written tickets allows work to be handed over during absence and leave.
            </p>
            <h4 class="heading-small">How to use them</h4>
            <p>
              There are a number of software solutions available each with different features. Many are free and quick to set up which means you can try one and if it isn’t quite right move on and try another.
            </p>
            <p>
              How you set up your boards is up to you, but it is usual to have workflow columns including:
            </p>
            <ol class="list-bullet">
              <li>icebox (unpriortised tasks)</li>
              <li>ready to do (the next most important things to do</li>
              <li>doing right now </li>
              <li>done</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Each ticket should be a user story, with a clear user need and acceptance criteria.
            </p>
            <h4 class="heading-small">Examples</h4>
            <img src="http://dummyimage.com/600x400/4d494d/686a82.gif&text=placeholder+image" alt="placeholder+image">

            <h2 class="heading-medium">Stand-up</h2>
            <p>
              Daily meetings with your team so you know what they’re doing and if they have any problems.
            </p>
            <h4 class="heading-small">What a stand-up is</h4>
            <p>
              The stand-up is a regular meeting you should have with your team.
            </p>
            <h4 class="heading-small">How a stand-up works</h4>
            <p>
              It’s a daily meeting that should last no more than 15 minutes. It’s best if you do it standing up, in a semicircle, in front of your project wall. This will help you to keep it short and allows your team members to point at user story cards on the wall to keep things on topic.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each member of your team should say:
            </p>
            <ol class="list-bullet">
              <li>what I worked on or produced yesterday</li>
              <li>what I’m working on today (and help I might need)</li>
              <li>what’s blocking me (ie stopping me from finishing a user story card)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Ask people to keep it brief and don’t be afraid to remind them of this. If people try to solve issues during the stand-up, stop the conversation and arrange a huddle after the stand-up to discuss in a smaller group.
            </p>


            <h2 class="heading-medium">Show and tell</h2>
            <p>
              A meeting where people from the rest of the organisation can find out what your team is doing and ask questions.
            </p>
            <h4 class="heading-small">What a show and tell is</h4>
            <p>
              This is a meeting that happens every few weeks in the delivery team work area. It gives the rest of the organisation a chance to:
            </p>
            <ol class="list-bullet">
              <li>see the most important work the team has done during that period</li>
              <li>hear their plans for the next few weeks</li>
              <li>listen to them and ask questions</li>
            </ol>
            <h4 class="heading-small">Why show and tell?</h4>
            <p>
              People outside the team get to look at or use what’s being developed by the team and form their view of how they’re meeting user needs. They’ll also leave the show and tell with information to share with the wider organisation afterwards.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even early in the development of a service (in the discovery and alpha phases), there are many things that the team can do to demonstrate the outcomes of their work. This gives you the chance to offer feedback to help shape what the team does next.
            </p>
            <h4 class="heading-small">How show and tells work</h4>
            <p>
              The delivery team runs the show and tell, but you can ask for specific things to be shown. It’s the team’s responsibility to make sure the meeting is useful to the people there. You should check with them beforehand.
            </p>
            <p>
              The team will highlight issues, dependencies, assumptions and risks that are affecting them but the meeting isn’t a forum for detailed review or discussion of these.
            </p>
            <p>
              The show and tell is an opportunity for you to ask questions about the work done and provide feedback. It’s not an opportunity to argue for changes in the team’s plans or challenge their user research - if you have concerns around these, take them up with the service manager before or after the meeting.
            </p>
            <h4 class="heading-small">Get involved</h4>
            <p>
              To give feedback, make a suggestion or share your experience, use the governance guidance hackpad.
            </p>

            <h2 class="heading-medium">Retrospective</h2>
            <p>
              A meeting to find out what’s working and what isn’t, so your team can continuously improve.
            </p>
            <h4 class="heading-small">What a retrospective is</h4>
            <p>
              A retrospective is a meeting at the end of a sprint where your team get a chance to talk about what went well and badly in that sprint, and take some actions to improve matters. 
            </p>
            <p>
              It can also cover a larger scope, eg a full project retrospective.
            </p>
            <h4 class="heading-small">Why do retrospectives?</h4>
            <p>
              A central principle of agile is quick feedback loops – you demonstrate something to the user as soon as possible so you can see how well it suits their needs. Retrospectives are the way we apply this to our own teams to find out what’s working and what isn’t, so a team can continuously improve.
            </p>
            <p>
              Having a regular retrospective means you can fine-tune your working processes and your environment to your needs by:
            </p>
            <ol class="list-bullet">
              <li>making small improvements often, ideally before problems start to fester</li>
              <li>identifying working practices that make you more efficient, productive or at least happier</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              This is a chance for everyone in your team to contribute to improving process and productivity.
            </p>
            <h4 class="heading-small">How a retrospective works</h4>
            <p>
              A retrospective takes this form:
            </p>
            <ol class="list-bullet">
              <li>gather data</li>
              <li>generate insights</li>
              <li>decide what to do</li>
            </ol>
            <h4 class="heading-small">The facilitator</h4>
            <p>
              All retrospectives must be facilitated. The facilitator’s role is to give everyone a chance to talk about their concerns and give positive feedback.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the same time, they make sure the meeting remains a structured, productive meeting and doesn’t become overly negative. Ideally, your facilitator will be someone outside of your team so your whole team can contribute, but it’s not essential.
            </p>
            <p>
              The facilitator needs to:
            </p>
            <ol class="list-bullet">
              <li>plan the retrospective</li>
              <li>make sure that everyone gets a chance to contribute</li>
              <li>keep the retrospective on track</li>
              <li>make sure actions are created and assigned</li>
              <li>manage time so that it does not run over</li>
              <li>Working agreements</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              You’ll find it helpful to have some working agreements for a retrospective. These can be stated if necessary, eg in the first retrospective your team has.
            </p>
            <p>
              Working agreements could be that:
            </p>
            <ol class="list-bullet">
              <li>everyone contributes</li>
              <li>no one speaks over the other (except for the facilitator)</li>
              <li>no phones or laptops are allowed – everyone should be concentrating on the discussion</li>
            </ol>
            <h4 class="heading-small">Outcomes of a retrospective</h4>
            <p>
              During the discussion you will uncover some successes you can celebrate, as well as some problems that you can fix or things you can improve.
            </p>
            <p>
              Make a list of actions that will address these. Aim to have done them within the next sprint or iteration<
            </p>
            <p>
              Some problems may take longer to fix, in which case you should try to make an action that will start the process of improving it by your next retrospective.
            </p>
            <p>
              Actions should:
            </p>
            <ol class="list-bullet">
               <li>be concrete and measurable (eg ‘write 10 more unit tests for the redirector’, or ‘speak to Jamie about arranging a project retrospective’; not ‘write more tests’, or ‘we should understand the lessons learned from this project’)</li>
               <li>have a date by which they should be completed</li>
               <li>be assigned to a specific person (and not to </li>‘the team’)</li>
               <li>not be assigned to someone who is not present</li>
            </ol>
            <P>
              Retrospectives should follow up on the actions of previous retrospectives to make sure they’ve been completed. If they’re consistently not getting done, you may have too many.
            </P>
            <h4 class="heading-small">Timings</h4>
            <P>
              Each of the activities should be timeboxed (has a set time it will run for), and it’s your facilitator’s job to make sure that your team stick to this.
            </P>
            <P>
              Build in about 10% ‘shuffle time’ to move between activities to make sure it doesn’t overrun.
            </p>
            <P>
              It’s OK to finish early if people have said what they need to. It’s not OK to overrun – if there is too much to say, have the team prioritise the top areas for discussion and/or book more time for the next retrospective.
            </p>
            <h4 class="heading-small">Example timeline</h4>
            <p>
              This timeline is based on a team of 8 to 10 and covers a 2-week sprint. 90 minutes is a reasonable amount of time to use for this scope and amount of people.
            </p>
            <p>
            <ol class="list-number">
              <li>Explain the scope and purpose of the session: 5 minutes</li>
              <li>Update on actions from last retrospective: 5 minutes</li>
              <li>Write down all the things that went well: 10 minutes</li>
              <li>Discuss all the good things: 10 minutes</li>
              <li>Write down all the things that went badly (15 minutes)</li>
              <li>Discuss all the bad things (20 minutes)</li>
              <li>Agree actions, assign them to someone with a deadline (15 minutes)</li>
            </ol>
