        When taking part in any training course, it’s important to remember that there are many different approaches to applying agile delivery management. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s worthwhile to learn a number of tools and techniques and strengthen your understanding with self-initiated learning and doing.

      <h3 class="heading-small">Book an agile training course</h3>
      <p>
        If you are a civil servant find and book your course through <a href="https://civilservicelearning.civilservice.gov.uk/">Civil Service Learning</a>.
      </p>
      <h3 class="heading-small">Delivery managers and scrum master training</h3>
      <p>
        Some options to think about when training are:
      </p>
      <ol class="list-bullet">
          <li>specific frameworks and methodologies: Start with lightweight frameworks and methodologies such as Scrum, Kanban and Extreme Programming (others are available)</li>
          <li>more specific practices such as: agile user stories, agile estimating, agile planning, managing teams (more are available)</li>
          <li>softer skills such as workshop facilitation, coaching, motivating teams</li>
      </ol>
      <h3 class="heading-small">Training for other team roles and stakeholders</h3>
      <p>
        If you need to find out more about agile and how it relates to your role, book a course that gives you an introduction and covers its benefits. Make sure that it’s a broad course that covers more than one methodology or framework.
